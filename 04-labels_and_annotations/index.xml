We can use either labels or annotations to attach metadata to Kubernetes objects. Labels can be used to select objects and to find collections of objects that satisfy certain conditions. In contrast, annotations are not used to identify and select objects. The metadata in an annotation can be small or large, structured or unstructured, and can include characters not permitted by labels.
Its just a place to store more metadata which is not used for any selection , grouping or operations.</description></item><item><title>Labels</title><link>https://kubernetes.ansilh.com/04-labels_and_annotations/01-labels/index.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Dec 2018 17:15:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kubernetes.ansilh.com/04-labels_and_annotations/01-labels/index.html</guid><description>Why we need labels ? If you have a bucket of white dominos and you want to group it based on the number of dots.
Lets say we want all dominos with 10 dots; we will take domino one by one and if its having 10 dots ,we will put it aside and continue the same operation until all dominos were checked.
Likewise , suppose if you have 100 pods and few of them are nginx and few of them are centos , how we can see only nginx pods ?</description></item></channel></rss>
